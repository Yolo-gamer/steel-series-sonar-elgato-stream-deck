early beta steel series sonar to Elgato plugin

This is an early development of an Elgato plugin that allows you to control steel series sonar with the stream deck.
Currently, only the mixer can be used, aka mute and volume adjustment.


So far, it's Windows OS only. To install, download the Plugin and run it.
